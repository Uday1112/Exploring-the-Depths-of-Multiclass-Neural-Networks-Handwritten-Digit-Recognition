# Exploring-the-Depths-of-Multiclass-Neural-Networks-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

This repository contains rules and objects to build a neural network model for handwriting digit recognition (0-9). The model is implemented using TensorFlow, a popular machine learning platform.

Observations:
The presented code consists of a neural network with three dense layers: two hidden layers with ReLU activation, and two output layers with linear activation. The model is clustered using the Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss function and the Adam optimizer. It is then trained on a dataset of handwritten digital images and tested. Finally, the model is used to make predictions on the model images.

This repository is useful for understanding and implementing neural networks for multiclass classification tasks, especially handwriting digit recognition.
